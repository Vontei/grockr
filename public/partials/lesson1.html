    <h2 class="lead" style='font-family: Nunito; font-size:3em; text-align: center;'>What is the stock market?</h2>
    <h4>Well, what is a market?</h4>
    <p>You can think of a market just like market where you buy your groceries.  A market is just a place where things are bought and sold.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>What is a stock?</h4>
    <p>Think of a company as a pile of bricks. Like a castle! A stock is one brick.  It is a little piece of a company.  If you own a stock of a company, you are considered to be a <em>shareholder</em>. Shareholders are the group of people who own the company!</p>
    <p>So...you can probably guess what a <em>stock...   market...</em> is then.</p>
    <p>The stock market is a place where you can go to buy stocks, or pieces of companies.<p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Why do people buy stocks?</h4>
    <p>That's easy! To make money!</p>
    <p>Let's say you buy one stock, or one share... <em> or piece </em> of a company, for $5.
      If that company makes money, their <em>market value</em>, which is the value of their stock in the market, goes up.
      But... you own one share of that company, which means if they make money, you make money!  If their market value goes up,
      and the price of their stock goes up to $10, you just made $5!

    <h4>How do you buy stocks?</h4>
    <p>Before the internet and computers, the stock market was actually a place you would go to buy and sell stocks.
      The most famous stock market in the world is the New York Stock Exchange, on Wall Street in New York City. The term <em>exchange</em>
      is another name for a specific stock market.  Today there are many exchanges all over the world, but here are a few in the United States:
      <ul>
        <li>NYSE: <em> The New York Stock Exchange</em></li>
        <li>NASDAQ: <em> National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations </em></li>
        <li>CSE: <em> Chicago Stock Exchange</em></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The stock market today is made up of many exchanges.  Most of them are now similar to online stores. However,
      in order to actually buy a stock, you must have someone called a <em>broker</em> do it for you. Whenever you a buy a stock,
      you place an <em>order</em> with you broker, who fills out the rest of the paperwork for you and makes sure your money is safe.</p>

    <p>Note: Brokers charge you for each order you place.  For example, a broker may charge $6 each time you buy and each time you sell. So... you need to make sure
      that you have at least made $6 when you sell your stock, if you want to make money!</p>

    <p>Brokers work at different <em>brokerages</em>, or the businesses that place orders for you. These brokerages are all online now and you can log in to their websites, and buy stocks just like you can
      buy things on Amazon or Ebay.</p>
    <p> Pretty cool right!?</p>

    <h4>How to pick a stock</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Find a company you know about or that interests you.</li>
      <li>Look at the current price of the stock, and compare it to the prices in the past. People who buy and sell stocks are called traders.
        Traders often use charts to look at the price of a stock over time. If it looks like the line goes up over time, it is called an <em>upward trend</em>... or... the <em>trendline</em> is positive.
        If the line goes down over time, the company is doing poorly, and the chart has a downward trend. You want to buy shares of stock of the companies with an upward trend.
      </li>
      <li>Check the news: If you search for a company in the news and the articles are positive and say good things, it is a good sign that you can buy that stock and the price will go up.
      If the news is bad, and the articles say bad things, chances are the price will go down, and you should not buy that stock.</li>
      <li>Ask yourself, how does this company make money? Do they sell computers, tractors, fruit, gasoline? When you know how a company makes their money,
        you can make a better prediction about whether their price will go up or down. For example, if you want to buy some shares of a toy company,
        their stock might be cheaper in the summer or fall, before the Christmas season.  So, buy in the fall, sell after Christmas.  </li>
    </ol>
